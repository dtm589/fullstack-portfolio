# My Full Stack Portfolio

This deployed website is my portfolio. It has a picture of me, my name, an about me section, my education, projects, contact me, and my resume. It uses a navigation bar on the side with links to each section in my page. The site also has links to each of my projects. It uses flex box and media query to accommodate all screen sizes.
